title: Introduction to Esfuse
---

Esfuse is a comprehensive toolchain that aims to simplify file transformation for different projects. It combines features from various other tools, such as Next.js, Docusaurus, or Esbuild, but also adds unique functionality, including a development server and routing.

Unlike many modern JS tools, Esfuse is written in JavaScript and uses third-party dependencies to avoid reinventing the wheel. It also doesn't prioritize speed benchmarks but rather offers an efficient and practical solution to file transformation.

Essentially, Esfuse serves as the "glue" that connects various configuration lines necessary for creating a new JavaScript project, eliminating the need for extensive and time-consuming configuration.

## Why Use Esfuse?

Esfuse was created to simplify the process of managing multiple projects with diverse requirements. Whether it's CLI tools, libraries, web applications, documentation websites, or small web experiments, Esfuse streamlines the toolchain configuration, making it easier to manage.

Especially useful for TypeScript projects, Esfuse is an opinionated tool designed to meet the specific needs of its creator. While it has been tested on production applications, the feature set and complexity are tailored to meet its creator's requirements.

## Is Esfuse Suitable for Production?

Esfuse is intended to satisfy the needs of its creator and has been used successfully on production applications. However, it's essential to note that the feature set and complexity are limited to those deemed valuable enough for inclusion by its creator. Therefore, it's recommended to evaluate whether Esfuse meets your project's specific requirements before using it in production.
